		<h2>A Legacy Carved in Ice and Snow</h2>
		
		<p>On <time datetime="1988-02-13">February 13, 1988</time>, Calgary welcomed the world as the <data value="15">XV</data> Olympic Winter Games opened with spectacular fanfare at McMahon Stadium. For 16 unforgettable days, the city of Calgary and nearby mountain communities of Canmore, Nakiska, and the Saddledome became the epicenter of winter athletic excellence.</p>
		
		<p>The 1988 Winter Olympics marked several historic firsts. Calgary built the world's first fully indoor Olympic speed skating oval, revolutionizing the sport with faster ice and better conditions. The Games also introduced new events including super giant slalom in alpine skiing and team events in ski jumping and nordic combined.</p>

			<h3>Unforgettable Moments</h3>
			
			<p>The Calgary Olympics gifted the world with stories that transcended sport. Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards, the lovable British ski jumper who finished last but won hearts worldwide with his determination and spirit. The Jamaican bobsled team made their historic Olympic debut, defying stereotypes and inspiring the world. Finnish ski jumper Matti Nyk&#228;nen dominated his sport with three gold medals, while East German Katarina Witt defended her figure skating title with grace and artistry.</p>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>&ldquo;I was a true Olympian. I had the Olympic spirit, and that's what it's all about.&rdquo;</p>

			<h3>Impact on Calgary</h3>
			<p>The Games transformed Calgary from an oil and gas city into an internationally recognized destination. The infrastructure built for the Olympics&mdash;including WinSport at Canada Olympic Park, the Olympic Oval, and the Saddledome&mdash;continues to serve athletes and the community nearly four decades later. The Games instilled a spirit of volunteerism and civic pride that defines Calgary to this day.</p>
			
			<p>Calgary became the first Canadian city to host the Winter Olympics, spending approximately <data value="829000000">$829 million</data> (<time datetime="1988">1988</time> dollars) to create world-class facilities. Unlike many Olympic host cities, Calgary's venues remain in active use, hosting international competitions and training Canada's next generation of winter athletes.</p>
